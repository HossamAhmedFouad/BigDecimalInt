Copilot is a program based on AI that can guess and complete the code for you. It's basically a very advanced form of auto complete.

I solved Question number 1 in the sheet by the follwing ways.

You describe what you want to do in a comments maybe as psuedocode, and then Co-Pilot attempts to predict what you want to do, and write it in c++ syntax or many other language.

Yes, the code worked excactly as i wanted, but it might be missing some corner cases that still you have to implement it on your own.

This technology is so powerfull and it can be used in very different fields to help developers or unfortunately to replace them in the future.

Here is the link of my experince with Copilot -> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H2_iWWgHpNft7f2a2PphGoENdXbDNs8E/view?usp=sharing
