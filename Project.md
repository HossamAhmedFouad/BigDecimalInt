# Tasks Done 
## 1- Operator (-) Done Works
## 2- Operator (<) Done  Works for both Negative and Postivie numbers

# Issues 

## 1- when initialing a class with a number greater than INT_MAX ##gives compiler error
## BigDecimalInt(long long n ) will be a solution 

## 2- Fixed Operator (>) to work for both Negative and positive ##numbers

## 3- Operator (+) gives logical error when entering  x = "-123" ## y = "123"
## x + y >> gives 246 instead of Zero . 

## 4- There was an logical error regarding setting value to 0 ##when invalid inputs are given , when entering x = "-123" y ##="abc"
## x - y >> result was 123 , Fixed

## 5- operator (+) gives logical error regarding setting value ##to 0
## x = "-123" y = "abc" 
## x + y >> gives 123 instead of -123
